Juventus  were kind of distorted and they had to pay the price. Captain Buffon made some nice saves. Juventus started playing well after the first fifteen minutes. The first half ended with Barcelona leading.</p>
<p>Barcelona showed some  brilliant counter attacking football in the second half. Morata scored an equalizer and Juventus were back in the game. The set up was brilliant. The game was in balance until Suarez scored an easy goal which bounced off Buffon, from Messi&#8217;s shot. Finally Neymar scored a injury time goal which was like cherry on top of cake. The match ended with Barcelona winning 3-1.</p>
<p>Juventus became the first team to loose six European Cup/Champions League finals. Barcelona claimed their third champions league in six years.</p>
